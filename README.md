# Dynamically generate UI from JSON and store the changes
## How to run the project

In the root project directory, you should install the dependencies with:

### `yarn`

Then you could run the whole app by using:

### `yarn start`

Or, you could run the client and the server separately running these in two separate terminals:
### `yarn start-client`


### `yarn start-server`

The server runs on port 3001, and react dev server - on port 3000

Enjoy :)
